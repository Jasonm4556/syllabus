# Grammar Specification

The following is the grammar specification for a variant of PL/0, specified in [EBNF notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form).

The lexical specification defines the tokens of the language and their
respective lexemes.  The EBNF notation for each token is equivalent to
a regular expression.

The grammar defines the syntax of the language.  Tokens are
represented in all caps, e.g., IDENT.  The parser takes as input a
stream of tokens and produces an AST according to the grammar, with
tokens as the leaves of the tree.

## Grammar

    // EBNF notation tips
    lowercase symbols are nonterminals
    UPPERCASE symbols are terminals (tokens from your lexer)
    ::= denotes a production
    { } means 0 or more
    [ ] means 0 or 1
    ( ) just groups symbols
    
    
    // declarations
    program      ::= block
    block        ::= vardecls funcdecls statement
    vardecls     ::= { VAR IDENT COLON type }
    funcdelcs    ::= { FUNC IDENT LPAREN [ formals ] RPAREN [ COLON type ] block }
    formals      ::= IDENT COLON type { COMMA IDENT COLON type }
    type         ::= INT | BOOL


    // statements
    statement    ::=   IDENT ASSIGN expr
                     | IDENT LPAREN exprlist RPAREN
                     | RETURN expr
                     | BEGIN { statement } END
                     | IF expr THEN statement [ ELSE statement ]
                     | WHILE expr DO statement
                     | READ IDENT
                     | WRITE expr
    exprlist     ::= [ expr { COMMA expr } ]


    // expressions
    expr         ::= simpleexpr [ relop simpleexpr ]
    simpleexpr   ::= term [ termop term ]
    term         ::= factor [ factorop factor ]
    factor       ::= IDENT [ LPAREN exprlist RPAREN ] | NUMBER | TRUE | FALSE | LPAREN expr RPAREN | NOT factor | MINUS factor


    // operations at each precedence of the expression
    relop        ::= LT | LTE | GT | GTE | EQ | NEQ
    termop       ::= PLUS | MINUS | OR
    factorop     ::= MULT | DIV | MOD | AND
